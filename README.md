üß† Design Decisions & Assumptions

Authentication: Implemented using JWT for secure user sessions.

Database: MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility and scalability.

Models:

    User: Stores user credentials and profile information.
    Book: Contains book details and an array of reviews.
    Review: Embedded within the Book model to simplify data retrieval.

Pagination: Implemented for the GET /api/books endpoint to handle large datasets efficiently.

Filters: Optional filters for author and genre are supported in the GET /api/books endpoint.

Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented; consider enhancing it for production environments.
